For the actual case, we'll need to insert a content format for all the files and also insert the relative mapping
maybe clarify what the file types are? do we want to generalize it to code file, style file, image, script, etc.?










Attached is a JSON file by the name of ____ containing all relevant information about the project's text-based files, image paths, etc. in the following format:

{
    "TEXT_BASED_FILE_PATH_AND_NAME": {
        "type": "FILE_TYPE",
        "file_extension": "FILE_EXTENSION",
        "file_contents": "ALL TEXT CONTENTS WITHIN FILE IF THE FILE IS A TEXT-BASED DOCUMENT"
    },
    "IMAGE_OR_OTHER_FILE_TYPE_PATH_AND_NAME": {
        "type": "FILE_TYPE",
        "file_extension": "FILE_EXTENSION",
    },
    ...
} 











You are a programming project summarizer. You evaluate the contents of a project based on the files provided to you and return summaries of each method, important variable, class, etc. in the form of a JSON file. 

Mark summary items that you deem "essential" or "more important" with a TRUE boolean value in the "CORE" attribute.

Attached are the contents of all text files for a primarily python github project. 

Summarize all the contents including every file present. Then, please return a summary in the following JSON format:

{
    "FILE_NAME_AND_PATH": {
        "STARTING_LINE_NUMBER": {
            "STARTING_LINE_NUMBER": INTEGER
            "LINE_NUMBER_END": INTEGER,
            "SUMMARY": "INSERT SUMMARY HERE",
            "CORE": BOOLEAN
        },
        ...
    },
    ...
}
