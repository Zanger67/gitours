## Using the App
After downloading the neccessary packages to run next.js, you can start up a test-build of
the app by navigating to the `githubsummarizer` directory in your terminal and then using the
command `npm run dev`.

## Important App Files
In the `githubsummarizer` directory, the JavaScript and CSS files that make up the app's pages
can be found in the `src/app` folder.

As of now, the only files in the source directory that are worth paying attention to are
`page.js`, `exampleText.js`, and `globals.css`.

- `page.js` contains the JavaScript code that makes up the app's one and only (as of now) page.
- `exampleText.js` contains constants and methods that are intended to be used for testing, and may be removed later.
- `globals.css` contains the CSS code for the app's one and only (as of now) page.
